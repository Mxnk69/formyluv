 <p>
    My love, you mean more to me than words could ever explain.
     Every smile of yours makes my world brighter, 
     and every moment with you feels like home.
    I love you so deeply, so purely,
     and so endlessly that I can’t imagine my life without you in it.
     I don’t just love you for today or tomorrow—I love you for forever.
     You’re the one I want to grow with, laugh with, and build a life with.
     One day, I want to call you my wife and love you even more than I already do now 🤍
