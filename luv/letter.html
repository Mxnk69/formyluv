   My love, <br> <br> 



I don’t think you’ll ever truly understand how much you mean to me, but I hope this letter helps you feel even a fraction of it. From the moment you came into my life, everything started to feel warmer, calmer, and more meaningful. You’re not just someone I love—you’re the person my heart chose without hesitation.

I love the way you exist so effortlessly in my thoughts, the way your smile can fix my worst days, and the way your presence feels like home. With you, love doesn’t feel complicated or forced—it feels natural, safe, and real. You make me want to be better, dream bigger, and believe in a future I genuinely look forward to.

I want you to know that my love for you isn’t temporary or shallow. I love you with intention, with patience, and with my whole heart. I don’t just see you in my present—I see you in my future. I want to grow with you, support you, and one day stand beside you as your partner for life. The thought of calling you my wife someday fills my heart with so much happiness and certainty.

No matter what life brings us, please remember this: you are deeply loved, endlessly cherished, and always chosen—by me. Today, tomorrow, and forever.

and remember on a field of the prettiest flowers, u would still be the prettiest and i would pick u.

I still remember how i felt when u confessed ur love to me and that day i was the happiest man alive and everyday u make me feel ever happier.

i remember all the moments u smiled, teased me, were angry at me, and in all of those moments u looked cute and hot to me.

i genuinely cant explain how happy u make me feel and how much i love u my love.

i hope our love may never end and u pick in a garden of pretty flower to marry me. <br>
                  I Love You.
<br>
Always yours,
❤️
